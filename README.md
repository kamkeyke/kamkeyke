## Howdy! 🦝

This is where I'll post the code for the mods I made for Minecraft, that is, when I have the courage.
- Currently working on no projects, I'm busy with some personal things.
- Learning Forge, but I intend to migrate to NeoForge.
- My codes will probably be chaotic and inefficient, but I'm learning, have mercy on me.
- For now, all my repositories are private, but one day I'll make them public.

## 📌 Projects
- **PermaFrost**
  A mod that would serve to complement the experience of an SMP that I was going to create with some friends. I started it through a tutorial, so there may be some strange things in older versions.
- **Kindergarten**
  A mod in which I add the children I had in SMPs as mobs in the game. Due to the lore and likings of each child, it depends on some other mods to add interactivity.
  (I'm still a little stuck on this one).

And that's it. 👋
